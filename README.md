# Epkg #

A wrapper for Gentoo commands (emerge, equery, eix) to make them feel more natural to users familiar with other distributions.

The syntax is aimed to be an amalgamation of the sane command names from apt-get, dpkg and yum. Actually closer to ipkg/opkg than anything else.

Patches and pull requests are welcome.
